Project: Investigate a Dataset (No show Medical Appointments) using Python and Jupyter Notebook 

## Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.

## Installing

•Install Jupyter Notebook to run investigate-a-dataset.ipynd

•Require the following libraries installed:

Numpy

Pandas

Matplotlib

csv



##  Project Data

The data set that I selected for analysis is No show Medical Appointments and comes from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments">Kaggle</a>.
 The data describes 100k medical appointment in Brazil and is focused on whether or not patients   showed up for their appointment.A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

## Analyse the data

Make questions that promote looking at relationships between multiple variables. I aimed to analyze at least one dependent variable and three independent variables in my investigation.
